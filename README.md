## Usage

### Next Word Prediction

1. Provide the text the model will learn from in the "Training Data" section.
2. Adjust the hyperparameters as desired, including the number of epochs, learning rate, and sequence length.
3. Click the "Train Model" button to start the training process.
4. Once training is complete, enter a seed text in the "Prediction" section and click "Predict Next Word" to generate the next word prediction.

### Time Series Forecasting

1. Upload a CSV file with a header row in the "Training Data" section.
2. Select the column with numerical data that you want to predict.
3. Adjust the hyperparameters as desired, including the number of epochs, learning rate, and sequence length percentage.
4. Click the "Train Model" button to start the training process.
5. Once training is complete, click the "Predict Next Value" button to generate the next value prediction.

The training progress and test set evaluation results will be displayed during and after the training process.
